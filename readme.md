This project lets you deploy an update server for [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) apps built on top of [micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro): You only need to run a single command and fill out two text fields.

The result will be faster and more lightweight than any other solution out there! :rocket:

- Pulls the latest release data from [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and caches it
- Refreshes the cache every 15 minutes (use `INTERVAL` environment value for custom number of minutes - [more](https://developer.github.com/changes/2012-10-14-rate-limit-changes/))
- When asked for an update, it returns the link to the GitHub asset directly
- Supports Windows and macOS apps
- Allows downloading the latest release for a platform: e.g. `/download/darwin`

## Usage

Firstly ensure that [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) is installed, then deploy an update server like this:

```bash
now -e NODE_ENV="production" zeit/hazel
```

Now you'll be asked for the value of three environment variables:

- `ACCOUNT`: Your username or organisation name on GitHub
- `REPOSITORY`: The name of the repository to pull releases from

Once the deployment has finished, paste the address into your auto updater:

```js
const { app, autoUpdater } = require('electron')
const { resolve } = require('url')

const server = <your-deployment-url>
const feed = resolve(server, 'update', process.platform, app.getVersion())

autoUpdater.setFeedURL(feed)
```

That's all! :tada:

2. Then move into the directory of your clone: `cd hazel`
3. Finally, run the development server like this: `npm run dev`

## Credits

Huge thanks to my ([@leo](https://github.com/leo)'s) friend [Andy](http://twitter.com/andybitz_), who suggested the name "Hazel" (since the software that handles the auto updating inside [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) is called "Squirrel") and [Matheus](https://twitter.com/matheusfrndes) for collecting ideas with me.
